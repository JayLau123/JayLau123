### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

:laughing: Iâ€™m always open to academic collaboration especially on physice-based machine learning, DFT, and qunatum chemistry for materials research. Please feel free to reach out to me via jayfree2023@outlook.com

:microscope: My research interests span physics, chemistry, materials science, computational science  and engineering, etc. Especially computer-aided molecular and materials design, synthesis, and optimization, with more emphasis on machine learning and data driven methods.



:computer: I seek to provide useful computing techniques to support break new grounds in these interdisciplinary fields to addresses questions with broad societal impact.

:bulb: Here are some of my most interested topics:

:heavy_check_mark: Can we aid the design process of molecules, materials, and devices by leverage on two complementary tools DFT and machine learning?

:heavy_check_mark: Can we be able to design materials with particular chemical compositions and crystal structure at the atomic level given a set of desired properties or functions, based on statistics, machine learning, and other computational/data-driven approaches?

:heavy_check_mark: Can we use ultra-fast Raman spectroscopy and tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy, combined with graph neural network(GNN), to understand matter with ultimate spatial and temporal resolutions?

## How to use my GitHub efficiently

### Save your time, find everything you need efficiently. Good luck!

#### Please take a look of 'README.md', there are brief introductions to each file in each repository. It will guide you to find the file you need quickly. 

#### I'm not used to write formulas and equations in 'READ.md', instead, I prefer writing formula with LaTeX in jupyter notebook. You can download the files and find the LaTeX code of all the formulas in your own jupyter notebook!

#### There are some other useful learning materials in each repsoitory such as popular publications, reference books, course lectures from UChicago, etc.

## Quick start

### Python tutorials

Basic syntax, data structures, functions, etc.

https://thepythonguru.com/

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3

### Anaconda

Use Anaconda to install Python and new packages on your computer.

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html

### Jupyter Notebook

Web-based interactive development environment for notebooks,code,and data.

https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html

### Numpy and Pandas
