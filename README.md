### Hi there 👋  

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on physice-based machine learning, DFT, and qunatum chemistry for materials research! :laughing:

My research interests span physics, chemistry, materials science, computational science  and engineering.

I seek to provide useful computing techniques to support break new grounds in these interdisciplinary fields to addresses questions with broad societal impact:

Can we use ultra-fast Raman spectroscopy and tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy, combined with graph neural network(GNN), to understand matter with ultimate space and time resolutions? 

Can we aid the design process of molecules, materials, and devices by leverage on two complementary tools DFT and machine learning?

Can we be able to design materials with particular chemical compositions and crystal structure at the atomic level given a set of desired properties or functions, based on statistics, machine learning, and other computational/data-driven approaches.

# How to use my GitHub efficiently

### Save your time, find everything you need efficiently. Good luck!

#### Please take a look of 'README.md', there are brief introductions to each file in each repository. It will guide you to find the file you need quickly. 

#### I'm not used to write formulas and equations in 'READ.md', instead, I prefer writing formula with LaTeX in jupyter notebook. You can download the files and find the LaTeX code of all the formulas in your own jupyter notebook!

#### There are some other useful learning materials in each repsoitory such as popular publications, reference books, course lectures from UChicago, etc.
