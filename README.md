### Hi there  :v:

ü¶´ I'm a Research Associate in Prof. Sam Peng's research group with research interests span physics, materials, and computational science, etc. Currently, we delve deep into the fascinating realm of metallic chemical elements lanthanide ($[\mathrm{Xe}] 4 \mathrm{f}^N$, where $N$ runs from $1\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)$ to $13\left(\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}\right)$ along the series of $\mathrm{Ln^{3+}}$), and the lanthanide-doped nanocrystal ($\beta-\mathrm{NaYF_4}:\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}/\mathrm{Tm}^{3+}/\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$, known as upconversion nanoparticles UCNPs). 

:atom: Depart from lanthanides' abundant electronic structure in solid, we try to explore microscopic interactions(electron, photon, phonon, etc) and energy transfer mechanisms (ED, MD, MPR, up-conversion, cross-relaxation, etc) with Judd-Ofelt theory and DFT. Grounded in an extensive theoretical framework and calculated transition rates, we implement Monte Carlo model to simulate the probabilistic, collective energy transfer behaviour among hundreds to millions of ions within single nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 4 $nm$ to 50 $nm$. 

üöÄ The overarching goal of these endeavors is to design custom-based UCNPs, perfect for their ultimate application: serving as long-term, multi-color optical probes in single-molecule tracking and imaging. Let‚Äôs push the boundaries of UCNPs research, illuminating paths for future innovations in spectroscopy and bio-imaging, and drive innovation together!


**üë®‚Äçüíª I seek to hack the energy transfer networks, build a useful computational model to provide insights and predictive support for the development of UCNPs. Here are some of my current most interested topics:**

:heavy_check_mark: How many term symbol $\mathrm{{ }^{2 S+1} L}$ should be involved for $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}, \mathrm{Tm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Er}^{3+}$ in $\beta-\mathrm{NaYF_4}$, and quantitatively describe the energy level's value, shifting, and broadening under crystal-field and external electromagnetic field?

:heavy_check_mark: How do we specify the existence of various energy transfer pathways in UCNP based on experimental observation and theoretical investigation beyond known categories such as electric-dipole induced transition(ED), magnetic-dipole induced transition(MD), multi-phonon relaxation, donor-acceptor energy transfer process(ET)? 

:heavy_check_mark: How do we obtain the overlap integral $\mathrm{S_0}$ experimently or computationally, and how many phonons could be involved in non-resonant energy transfer processes due to energy mismatching between donor and acceptor?

:heavy_check_mark: Should we take into account the local site symmetry responsible for the selection rules at different lattice sites, as viewed from the perspective of a single ion?

:heavy_check_mark: How many adjustable variables cound be optimizaed (lanthanides categories and percentages, crystal structure, particle size, laser power density and polarization, etc) that supprot precise tuning of the photonphysical properties and high energy transfer efficiency of UCNP?

:heavy_check_mark: Could we explore the potential of correlating the Monte-Carlo model with graph neural networks (GNNs) due to their structural similarities?
