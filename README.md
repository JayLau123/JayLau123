### Hi there üëã  

:microscope: My research interests span physics, chemistry, materials science, computational science and engineering, etc. Especially molecular and materials design, characterization, and optimization, with more emphasis on **AI4Science** (computer-aided, data-driven, statistics-based, physics-informed method), and other exciting ways of exploiting scientific computation to understand the world.

üöÄ I seek to provide useful computing techniques to support break new grounds in these interdisciplinary fields to addresses questions with broad societal impact. Here are some of my most interested topics:

:heavy_check_mark: Can we aid the design process of molecules, materials, and devices by leveraging on DFT and machine learning? While DFT is an interpretable and alternative tool for machine learning.

:heavy_check_mark: Can we be able to design materials with particular chemical compositions and crystal structure at the atomic level given a set of desired properties or functions, based on CNN(consistutes), GNN(structure), and other computational/data-driven approaches?

:heavy_check_mark: Can we use ultra-fast Raman spectroscopy and tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy, combined with graph neural network(GNN), to understand matter at atomic scale with ultimate spatial and temporal resolutions? 

üçª I really appreciate prospective collaborators reaching out, especially on physice-based machine learning, qunatum chemistry, and HPC for materials research and quantum computing. 

üìß Please feel free to drop me an email: jayfree2023@outlook.com

### üë®‚Äçüíª Current project: Machine learning-aided characterization for molecules based on graph theory.

Probably approximately correct function(PAC) explains how to find the best candidate structure $x$ with a high probability, which suits for loss function in our model.
 
$$p(|f(x)-y| \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\delta$$

$x$ is the candidate structure, $y$ is the observed properties $P$ from Raman spectrum, which is the true label. If the prediction is very accurate, then $|f(x)-P|\leq \epsilon$. We can calculate the spectrum properties with known atoms and their structure based on quantum chemistry. Let's denote it as $\boldsymbol{f}$. We hope to find the best candidate structure $x$ with a high probability: $p(|f(x)-P| \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\delta$. However, regardless of the difficulties to choose exchange-correlation functional $E_{XC}$ in solving Kohn-Sham equation(KS), the $\boldsymbol{f}$ can be very computational-expensive. Alternatively, can we use current database from PubChem, NIST, Wiley‚Äôs library, etc. to train a convolutional neural network to predict spectrum, so that given a molecular structure (graph-based representation), it will output the spectrum automatically? We are going to build such a network named forward model $\boldsymbol{f}$.

## How to use my GitHub efficiently

### Save your time, find everything you need efficiently. Good luck!

#### Please take a look of 'README.md', there are brief introductions to each file in each repository. It will guide you to find the file you need quickly. 

#### I'm not used to write formulas and equations in 'READ.md', instead, I prefer writing formula with LaTeX in jupyter notebook. You can download the files and find the LaTeX code of all the formulas in your own jupyter notebook!

#### There are some other useful learning materials in each repsoitory such as popular publications, reference books, course lectures from UChicago, etc.
