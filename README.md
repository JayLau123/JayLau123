# How to use my GitHub efficiently

### Save your time, find everything you need efficiently. Good luck!

#### Please take a look of 'README.md', there are brief introductions to each file in each repository. It will guide you to find the file you need quickly. 

#### I prefer not writing so many formulas and equations in 'READ.md', instead, I prefer writing formula with LaTeX in jupyter notebook. You can download the files you need and find the LaTeX code of all the formulas in your own jupyter notebook!

#### There are some useful learning materials in each repsoitory such as popular publications, books, course lectures from UChicago, etc.
